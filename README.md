# 🚆 RailOptima – Intelligent Rail Asset Management

RailOptima is a Smart India Hackathon project designed to optimize train operations at railway depots. It automates the selection of trains based on readiness parameters such as fuel levels, maintenance status, and scheduling, helping depot managers make faster and more accurate decisions.

---

## 📌 Overview

RailOptima provides a web-based interface that evaluates train readiness and displays suitable options for dispatch. It reduces manual errors and streamlines depot operations through intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automated train selection based on readiness
- 📊 Dashboard for depot managers
- 🔍 Parameter-based filtering (fuel, maintenance, schedule)
- 🌐 Static deployment via GitHub Pages

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input**: Train data is either hardcoded or fetched (future enhancement).
2. **Logic**: JavaScript evaluates each train against readiness criteria.
3. **Output**: Ready trains are displayed for selection.
